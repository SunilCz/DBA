-- Step 1: Log in to PDB as the "studentpdb" user
CONNECT studentpdb/your_password;

-- Step 2: Create the table "employee" with necessary columns and constraints
CREATE TABLE employee (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR2(50),
    department VARCHAR2(50),
    salary NUMBER(10, 2),
    CONSTRAINT chk_salary CHECK (salary >= 0)
);

-- Step 3: Create a synonym for the "employee" table
CREATE SYNONYM emp_synonym FOR employee;

-- Step 4: Use the synonym to display information from the "employee" table
-- Insert some sample data
INSERT INTO employee (employee_id, name, department, salary) VALUES (1, 'John', 'IT', 5000);
INSERT INTO employee (employee_id, name, department, salary) VALUES (2, 'Jane', 'HR', 6000);

-- Display information using the synonym
SELECT * FROM emp_synonym;
